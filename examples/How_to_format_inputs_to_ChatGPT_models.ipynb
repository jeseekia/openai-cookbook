For example, if we want to add 1/4 and 2/3, we need to find a common denominator. We can do this by multiplying the denominators together, which gives us 12. Then, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 12. To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator of 1/4 by 3, which gives us 3/12.
